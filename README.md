# PernikComputers
PernikComputers is an ASP.NET MVC online store application that sells computers and computer components. It has functionality that allows you to create, delete, view, edit and order a product. It has an adaptive design and **computer configurator**. The application allows you to create a computer only with compatible components. It has three types of users: client, employee and administrator. 
## Clients
Each registered user is a client of the site and can order a product. He can also change his own information - names, phone or password.
## Employees
Employees are created by an administrator with a fixed password "employee123". When their accounts are given, they need to change this password for better security.
## Administrator
There is a fixed administrator with username "admin" and password "123!@#qweQWE". He has full control over the web application:
- promote employees to administrators
- make CRUD operations on products
